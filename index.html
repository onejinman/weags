    Microstructure of a spatial map in the
entorhinal cortex
Torkel Hafting1*, Marianne Fyhn1*, Sturla Molden1†, May-Britt Moser1 & Edvard I. Moser1
The ability to find one’s way depends on neural algorithms that integrate information about place, distance and
direction, but the implementation of these operations in cortical microcircuits is poorly understood. Here we show that
the dorsocaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a directionally oriented, topographically organized neural map
of the spatial environment. Its key unit is the ‘grid cell’, which is activated whenever the animal’s position coincides with
any vertex of a regular grid of equilateral triangles spanning the surface of the environment. Grids of neighbouring cells
share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations (their phases) differ. The spacing and size of
individual fields increase from dorsal to ventral dMEC. The map is anchored to external landmarks, but persists in their
absence, suggesting that grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration-based map of the spatial environment.
Navigation in mammals depends on a distributed, modularly organized
brain network1–7. The network computes and represents positional
and directional information, as indicated by the existence of
‘place cells’1 and ‘head-direction cells’3 in the hippocampal and
parahippocampal cortices. The function of hippocampal place cells
has received particular attention1,2. Place cells respond to a wide
variety of spatial inputs, including extrinsic landmarks8,9 and translational
and directional movement signals10–13. Along with the strong
involvement of the hippocampus in spatial learning1,14, the convergent
expression of metric positional and directional information in
place cells pointed, early on, to a pivotal role for the hippocampus in
spatial computation and representation1–7,14,15. However, whereas
place cells were originally thought to have general navigational
functions, it became clear that sensory information about space is
differentiated by the hippocampus into a multitude of contextspecific
representations16–21, which can be retrieved independently
from degraded versions of the original input22,23. This diversification
of stored information is consistent with a principal role for the
hippocampus in event- or context-specific memory24,25, and raises
the possibility that context-independent position information is
computed upstream of the hippocampus5,6, for example, by algorithms
that integrate self-motion information into a metric and
directionally oriented representation that is valid in all contexts4–6.
A map with such properties has not been identified, but recent
work has shown that location is represented accurately before the
hippocampus in the superficial layers of the dorsocaudal region of
the medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC)26. Whereas place cells in the
hippocampus usually have a single confined firing field1, upstream
dMEC neurons have multiple discrete fields of similar amplitude26.
To determine whether the dMEC has a map-like structural organization,
we recorded spike activity in this area while rats ran in
enclosures that were large enough to capture possible regularities
in the spatial organization of neural activity (14 rats, 211 cells).
Grid cells have tessellating firing fields
To visualize the spatial structure of firing fields in dMEC neurons, we
first tested the rats in a circular enclosure with a diameter of 2m (45
neurons from 6 rats). Individual neurons in layer II of the dMEC had
multiple discrete firing fields with distinct inhibitory surrounds
(Fig. 1)26. The expanded recording environment revealed a striking
spatial organization of the subfields that was not apparent in the
smaller, conventionally sized enclosures used previously. In every
isolated principal neuron, the firing field formed a grid of regularly
tessellating triangles spanning the whole recording surface (Fig. 1b,
left and middle columns). All nodes of activity were sharply delineated
from the background, although the individual peak firing
rates varied. The regular nature of the activity distribution was
verified by spatial autocorrelation analyses, which for all cells showed
a tessellating pattern similar to that of the original rate maps (Fig. 1b,
right column; Supplementary Fig. S1).
To examine the geometric structure of the grid, we measured the
separation of the peaks in the autocorrelogram. If the unit is an
equilateral triangle, the central peak of the autocorrelogram should
be surrounded by six equidistant peaks forming the vertices of a
regular hexagon. The analysis confirmed this prediction. First, within
each firing grid, the distance from the central peak of the autocorrelogram
to the nearest six peaks was nearly constant. Although the
average of this distance varied from 39 to 73 cm across different cells
of different rats, the standard deviation (s.d.) within a single grid was
only 3.2 cm (mean s.d. across 45 cells). Additional hexagons of
equidistant firing peaks were formed at multiples of the distance to
the nearest hexagon, implying that the pattern was regular across the
entire field. Second, the angular separation of the vertices of the inner
hexagon was in multiples of 60 degrees (Fig. 1c; s.d. ¼ 7.1 degrees), as
expected if the unit was an equilateral triangle.
The location of the grid vertices (the phase) remained stable across
recording trials (Supplementary Fig. S2)26. The rats were tested twice
in the large cylinder at an interval of 15 min. The peak firing rates in
each subfield on the first trial correlated weakly but significantly with
the peak rates in the same areas on the second trial (mean
correlation ^ s.e.m., r ¼ 0.35 ^ 0.06, t(25) ¼ 6.1, where 25 degrees
of freedom are indicated in parentheses, P , 0.001), implying that
activity was distributed non-randomly across the nodes of the firing
lattice.
The structure of the grid was not confined by the boundaries of the
enclosure (Fig. 1d). When the environment was expanded, the

number of activity nodes increased, but their density remained
constant (t(28) ¼ 1.2, P . 0.20; 29 cells from 3 rats), suggesting
that grids may potentially have infinite size (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Grid cells are topographically organized
Grid cells in the dMEC showed a striking topographic organization.
Grids recorded at the same electrode location shared a number of
metric properties, including spacing, orientation (direction) and
field size (Fig. 2). Spacing was expressed for each grid as the distance
from the central peak to the vertices of the inner hexagon in the
autocorrelogram (the median of the six distances). While spacing
varied by more than 30 cm in the entire cell population, the s.d.
among cells recorded on the same tetrode was only 2.1 cm (mean
across 12 sets of simultaneously recorded cells, n ¼ 42). The orientation
of the grid was expressed in the autocorrelogram as the angle f
between a camera-defined reference line (0 degrees) and a vector to
the nearest vertex of the inner hexagon in the counterclockwise
direction (Fig. 2e inset). The entire range of orientations was
represented in the population as a whole (from 1 to 59 degrees),
but among cells recorded on the same tetrode, orientation varied
minimally (s.d. ¼ 1.8 degrees). The size of the individual fields was
estimated as the area covered by the central peak of the autocorrelogram,
using a threshold of r ¼ 0.2. Field sizes ranged from 326 to
709 cm2 in the population as a whole. The s.d. among cells recorded
at the same electrode location was 42 cm2.
Although spacing, orientation and field size were almost invariant
at individual recording locations, spacing and field size increased
with distance from the postrhinal border, resulting in more dispersed
fields at more ventral electrode positions. This pattern was observed
both within animals (Fig. 2a–e) and between animals (Fig. 2f–h;
Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 2 shows the difference between grid
cells at two electrode locations, one near the postrhinal border and
one 560 mmdeeper, in a rat with a double dMEC implant tested in the
large circular enclosure. The spacing of the grid was consistently
denser at the dorsal position (Fig. 2e). In the dorsal cells, the spacing
ranged from 39.1 to 43.0 cm (14 cells recorded over 3 days). In the
more ventrally located cells, the spacing ranged from 48.1 to 52.2 cm
(5 cells recorded over 2 days). The increase in spacing at the ventral
position was accompanied by an increase in the size of the individual
fields (dorsal 353–583 cm2; ventral 511–637 cm2; t(17) ¼ 2.4,
P , 0.05). A similar topographic arrangement was revealed when
one set of tetrodes was lowered tangentially along the border of layers
II and III (yellow circles in Fig. 2b). Over a distance of 100 mm, the
spacing increased from between 41.9 and 45.9 cm (n ¼ 3) to between
44.9 and 49.7 cm (n ¼ 4). These results were replicated in two other
rats with double implants (17 cells) as well as in a larger sample of rats
running in a smaller square box (1m2; 11 rats, 57 cells; Fig. 2f–h and
Supplementary Fig. S4). In the latter group, the distance from the
postrhinal border correlated significantly with both the spacing of the
grid (r ¼ 0.82, degrees of freedom, d.f. ¼ 55, P , 0.001) and the size
of the individual fields (r ¼ 0.79, P , 0.001). The field size was
quadratically proportional to the spacing (r ¼ 0.75, P , 0.001).
Like spacing and field size, orientation of the grid varied between
electrode locations (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S4). In Fig. 2, the
angle with the camera-defined horizontal line was between 26.7 and
32.7 degrees at the recording location near the postrhinal border
(n ¼ 14) and between 19.7 and 22.1 degrees at the more ventral
location on the contralateral side (n ¼ 5) (Fig. 2e). However,
although the entire range of orientations was represented across
animals, we were unable to detect any systematic change from dorsal
to ventral in dMEC (r ¼ 20.13, P ¼ 0.30).
Although grids of neighbouring cells had similar spacing, field size
and orientation, their phases (the vertex locations) were apparently
not related. Collectively, grids from a small number of units recorded
simultaneously at the same electrode position filled up the entire
space of the recording arena (Fig. 2). Because neighbouring cells had
similar grid spacing and grid orientation, a slight phase shift in each
of the grids was sufficient to superimpose the vertices of the grids
almost completely (Fig. 3a). Cross-correlation of the rate maps of cell
pairs recorded simultaneously at the same electrode location yielded
a regular multi-peaked surface with a structure very similar to that of
each cell’s autocorrelogram, except that the peaks were offset from
the origin in most cases (Fig. 3b). Cross-correlation of cells recorded
at different locations (with different spacing and orientation) gave
cross-correlograms with more dispersed peaks and lower peak
amplitudes (Supplementary Fig. S5). Among the co-localized cells,
the average phase shift, expressed as the distance from the origin to
the nearest peak in the cross-correlogram, was evenly distributed,
extending from 0 to a maximum of 0.5 of the spacing of the
corresponding autocorrelograms, both in the group as a whole and
in individual recordings (Fig. 3c). The distribution of phase shifts did
not deviate significantly from uniformity (x(4) ¼ 0.84 with bins
corresponding to 20% of the maximally possible grid spacing) and
was not related to the distance from the postrhinal border (r ¼ 0.13,
d.f. ¼ 43, n.s.). These results suggest that the complete surface of the

environment was represented at each dorsoventral level of the dMEC,
for every spacing and every orientation of the map.
Grids are anchored to external cues
How does the spatial map in dMEC contribute to navigation? A key
question is whether locations of discharge in grid cells are determined
by external landmarks (allothetic cues) or by information generated
by the rat’s own movement (idiothetic cues). The stability of the grid
vertices across successive trials in the same enclosure (Supplementary
Fig. S2) suggests that allothetic cues exert a significant influence. To
test their influence more directly, we rotated a cue card on the wall of
a circular test box while recording from grid cells in dMEC (3 rats, 24
cells). Distal cues were masked by curtains. When the cue card was
rotated 90 degrees, the grid rotated similarly (24/24 cells; Fig. 4;
Supplementary Fig. S6). The correlation between the rate maps of the
initial baseline trial and the rotation trial was substantially lower than
between trials with the cue card in the same position (Fig. 4b;
t(23) ¼ 4.6, P , 0.001). There was no change in grid spacing or
field size (Fig. 4c and d; t , 0.5). Counter-rotating the rate map from
the rotation trial reversed the drop in spatial correlation (Fig. 4a and
b; t(23) ¼ 1.6, P ¼ 0.10), supporting the notion that phase and
orientation are set by external landmarks.
Grid structure persists after cue removal
To determine whether allothetic cues were also necessary for
maintaining grid-like activity during exploration, we asked whether
grids were expressed after all visual cues were removed. Spike activity
was recorded in total darkness for 30 min after an initial period of
10 min with the lights on (4 rats, 33 cells; Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Fig. S7). The grid was maintained in darkness. Darkness had no
significant effect on the spacing of the grid, and there was no change
in average firing rate or spatial information per spike (t , 1.5,
P . 0.15), suggesting that the existence of a grid-like firing structure
was independent of allothetic information. Yet, in the majority of the
cells, the onset of total darkness caused a weak dispersal or displacement
of the vertices, expressed as a moderate decrease in the spatial
correlation of the rate maps (Fig. 5b; t(29) ¼ 6.5, P , 0.001). The
decrease in spatial correlation is consistent with a role for allothetic
cues in determining the phase of the grid, that is, in aligning the grid
to the external reference frame. Stationary non-visual cues contributed
minimally to the firing positions in darkness (Supplementary
Fig. S8).
Grid development in a novel environment
The persistence of firing structure after perturbations of external
sensory input suggests that grids may to a large extent be based on
hardwired network mechanisms. If this is true, they may stabilize
rapidly in a novel environment. We tested this prediction by recording
grid cells for 30 min while rats explored a square enclosure in a
novel room (room N; 7 rats, 24 cells). Before and after this trial, the
rats ran in a similar enclosure in a familiar room (F and F0 ). Visual
inspection suggested that the grid pattern was expressed from the
outset (Fig. 6a). Firing locations were mostly stable from the first time
the rat passed through the area, both in light (Fig. 6; Supplementary

Fig. S9) and in total darkness (Supplementary Fig. S7). The development
of firing was estimated by correlating for each grid cell the
final firing rate at each position in the environment (estimated
during the last 10 min of the trial) with the firing rate at the same
locations (if visited) for blocks of 2 min throughout the preceding
20 min. Firing locations during the first 2 min were significantly
correlated with firing locations at the end of the trial (mean
correlation ^ s.e.m. ¼ 0.53 ^ 0.04; Fig. 6b). However, the correlation
was weaker during the first blocks than later (Fig. 6b; Block
effect: F9,207 ¼ 8.5, P , 0.001), suggesting that stabilization of the
grid, like stabilization of hippocampal place fields18,27, requires some
minimum exposure. The delay may reflect the time needed to set
phase and orientation in relation to context-specific landmarks. The
orientation of the grid in the new room was different from the
orientation in the familiar room (mean change ¼ 20.8 ^ 3.2
degrees). The orientation drifted only minimally between the two
tests in the familiar room (2.3 ^ 0.5 degrees), as expected if grids are
aligned with external landmarks.
Discussion
This study points to the dMEC as part of a neural map of the spatial
environment. The basic unit of the map is the grid cell, whose
multiple discrete firing fields invariantly form a stable, regularly
tessellating structure of equilateral triangles. Grid spacing, grid
orientation and field size were topographically organized, with
minimal variation locally, but significant variation across the surface
of the dMEC. Spacing and field size increased from the dorsal to the
ventral part of dMEC, raising the possibility that this gradient is
continuous with the broad, single-peaked firing fields in the intermediate
band of the MEC26. In contrast, the phase of the grid
appeared to vary randomly among cells recorded at the same brain
location, implying that the entire surface of the environment was
represented within a local cell ensemble with a common grid spacing
and orientation. These observations point to a modular local
organization of the entorhinal spatial map, similar to the columnar
organization of other areas of neocortex28,29. The mosaic organization
of the superficial layers of dMEC30 represents a possible substrate
for the modularity of the spatial map.
A fundamental property of the entorhinal spatial map is the
apparent universality of several key parameters. The triangular firing
structure and the spacing of the grid cells were impervious to
displacement or removal of external sensory input, in much
the same way that units in more ventromedial parts of MEC
preserve firing fields after geometric transformation of the local
environment31. The persistent firing structure of the population is
reminiscent of the coherence across environments expressed by headdirection
cells3,12,32,33 and suggests that in both systems the same
neurons may perform the same algorithms in different environments.
The maintenance of grid structure during visual deprivation
points to path integration7,34–36 as a probable motor of the spatial
periodicity. Whether the position vector is computed in the dMEC
itself or outside remains to be determined, but the convergence in the
dMEC of directional input from the dorsal presubiculum37 and
visuospatial input from the postrhinal cortex38,39 puts the dMEC in
a unique position to perform this computation. A direct involvement
of the dMEC in path integration is consistent with the disruption of
return paths40 and spatial search patterns41 during navigation in rats
with entorhinal lesions that include the dorsocaudal pole. However,
although the spatial structure of firing may be determined by selfmotion
cues, phase and orientation were controlled by the specific
landmarks of each environment, in the same way that specific cues
are needed to initialize the directional preferences of the headdirection
cells3. These alignment processes presumably involve
associative learning.
The representation of place, distance and direction in the same
network of dMEC neurons would permit the computation of a
continuously updated metric representation of the animal’s location.
The underlying algorithms may have similarities with those

proposed previously for recurrent networks of head-direction cells42
and hippocampal place cells15. By way of their intrinsic connections43–
45, entorhinal neurons may be able to support a twodimensional
continuous attractor-based representation of the
environment, in which activity is moved between successive mutually
connected cell ensembles by a path-integration-based mechanism2,15.
The constant spacing, field size and orientation of grids in neighbouring
cells suggest that conjunctions of active neurons are repeated
regularly as the animal moves over a surface. If the start location is
retained, a cyclically organized map might be sufficient to signal
location in environments of any size, and work equally well at the
edges and in the centre of the map5.
One potential problem with the grid structure is that the population
code at each vertex of the grid may be relatively similar. This
potential ambiguity could be resolved by using the small, but reliable
rate differences between the vertices, or perhaps more efficiently, by
integrating over grids with different spacing and orientation. The
mechanism by which information about distance and direction is
extracted is not known, but successful read-out would probably
depend significantly on temporal integration of neural activity.
Sustained firing in single cells46 and reverberatory circuits47 may
contribute to such integration. Although the wide distribution of
grid phase allows the animal’s position to be predicted from the
collective firing of small local cell ensembles26, it remains to be
determined whether read-out occurs within the entorhinal cortex,
or in one or several of its hippocampal or parahippocampal target
structures4–6.
The results suggest that the entorhinal cortex may support
some spatial computations that were previously attributed to the
hippocampus1,2,14,15. Although hippocampal place cells respond to
translational and directional information10–13, similar influences
were observed upstream in layer II of the dMEC. The contextual
specificity of hippocampal representations16–21 suggests that during
encoding, the hippocampus associates output from a generalized,
path-integration-based coordinate system with landmarks or other
features specific to the individual environment or context. Through
backprojections to the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex39,
associations stored in the hippocampus may reset the path integrator
as errors accumulate during exploration7,36,48,49. Anchoring the output
of the path integrator to external reference points stored in the
hippocampus or other cortical areas may enable alignment of
entorhinal maps from one trial to the next, even when the points
of departure are different.
METHODS
Subjects. Fourteen male Long Evans rats (350–450 g) kept at ,90% of freefeeding
body weight were implanted above the dMEA with a microdrive
containing four tetrodes26. Six of these rats received an additional microdrive
in the contralateral hemisphere either above the dMEA (n ¼ 5) or above the
dorsal CA3 of the hippocampus18 (n ¼ 1). Tetrodes were made of 17-mmdiameter
polyimide-coated platinum–iridium (90%–10%) wire.
Enclosures and rooms. Neuronal activity was recorded during pellet chasing in
enclosures of different size and shape: a large circular box (200 cm in diameter,
50 cm high), a small circular box (90 cm in diameter, 50 cm high), a square box
(100 cm £ 100 cm £ 50 cm high), and a linear track (235 cm long, 10 cm wide
and 50 cm above the floor). A cue card (45 cm £ 50 cm or 20 cm £ 30 cm) was
displayed at a constant location in each box.
Training and testing. Tetrodes were moved in daily steps of ,50 mm or less
towards layer II of the dMEA until multiple distinguishable large-amplitude
units were obtained. Six rats were tested on alternating trials in two circular
enclosures of different size at the same location. In three rats, the cue card was
